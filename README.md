# üöÄ Welcome to My Data Science Journey!

Hello there! I'm Beatriz, a passionate data scientist fresh out of the academic realm with a shiny new master's degree in Applied Statistics and Data Science. üéì Armed with a blend of R and Python, I'm on a mission to extract meaningful insights from data and tell compelling stories through analytics.

## About Me:
- Master's in Applied Statistics and Data Science
- Aspiring Data Scientist & Storyteller

## What to Expect:
Delve into my repository to discover a varied array of data projects capturing my academic journey, including those accomplished during my Master's Degree using R and Python. I am currently in the process of reformatting and refining these projects, ensuring they align with the latest techniques and best practices in the ever-evolving field of data science. Additionally, join me on my ongoing exploration of SQL as I weave this new skill into the fabric of my data science narrative.
