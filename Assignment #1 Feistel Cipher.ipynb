    "# Assignment 1: Feistel Cipher\n",
    "\n",
    "### by: Beatriz Vela (0451080) \n",
    "\n",
    "Feistel Cypher structure was designed by Horst Feistel, it is an encryption algorithm that has a symmetrical structure, can be invertible, uses the same encryption and decryption algorithms, and was used to develop many DES models. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Encryption\n",
    "\n",
    "Like any encryption algorithm, a Feistel structure will take a plain text and encrypt the message contained between it. That is, to make it unreadable unless the key is known. It is important to note that the operations in which Feistel Cipher is done are performed in machine language: binary. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following is needed to do encryption and decryption using a Feistel structure: a plain text message, a key $K_i$, and a Feistel Function $F(R_i, K_i)$. For this assignment the Feistel Function is given by: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F(R_i, K_i) = R_i*K_i\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "$R_i:$ right half block in the i-th iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "$K_i:$ i-th single bit from original key \n",
    "\n",
    "which corresponds to AND or binary multiplication. The rules of binary multiplication are shown in the table below: \n",
    "\n",
    "| A x B | Product |\n",
    "|:----: | :----:  |\n",
    "|0x0 = |0|\n",
    "|0x1 = |0|\n",
    "|1x0 = |0|\n",
    "|1x1 = |1|\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The following steps draw some insight on how the Feistel Structure works. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. At the start of the algorithm, a plain text will be converted to binary using an ASCII table. The plain text will be processed on 64 bits (8-bytes) blocks. It will be separated into two: a left half block $L_0$ and a right half block $R_0$. \n",
    "2. In the first round $R_0$ will be multiplied by the first generated key: $K_0$ which be of length 32 bits (4-bytes) generating the Feistel Function $F_0$ given by this Assignment. \n",
    "3. Then, $F_0$ will $\\oplus$ with the left half block $L_0$. The table below shows a truth table for the operation $A \\oplus B$.\n",
    "\n",
    "| A $\\oplus$ B | Product |\n",
    "|:----: | :----:  |\n",
    "|0 $\\oplus$ 0|0|\n",
    "|0 $\\oplus$ 1|1|\n",
    "|1 $\\oplus$ 0|1|\n",
    "|1 $\\oplus$ 1|0|\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The product of $F_0 \\oplus L_0$ will create the right half block $R_1$ for the second round, and the left half block $L_1$ will simply be the same as $R_0$. \n",
    "5. As the number of rounds increases, steps 2 - 4 will be repeated. At the end of the encryption algorithm the left and right half blocks do a final swap, convert binary to ASCII and the encrypted text will be revealed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, after the first round we will have that: \n",
    "\\begin{gather*}\n",
    "L_1 = R_0 \\\\\n",
    "R_1 = L_0\\oplus F(R_0,K_0)\n",
    "\\end{gather*}\n",
    "\n",
    "For second round: \n",
    "\\begin{gather*}\n",
    "L_2 = R_1 \\\\\n",
    "R_2 = L_1 \\oplus F(R_1,K_1)\n",
    "\\end{gather*}\n",
    "\n",
    "## Decryption: \n",
    "\n",
    "For the decryption process, the Feistel cipher uses reverse engineering using the same keys that were used for the encryption algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "Starting from the last round up we have that to decrypt we have that the initial conditions are: \n",
    "\\begin{gather*}\n",
    "L_3 = L_2 \\\\\n",
    "R_3 = R_2\n",
    "\\end{gather*}\n",

    "First round of decryption: \n",

    "R_4 = L_3 \\\\\n",
    "L_4 = R_3 \\oplus F(L_3,K_1)\n",

    "\n",
    "Second round of decryption: \n",
    "\\begin{gather*}\n",
    "R_5 = L_4 \\\\\n",
    "L_5 = R_4 \\oplus F(L_4,K_0)\n",
